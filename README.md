# BrillouinView
An Advanced Tool for Calibration, Visualization, and Modeling of Brillouin Spectroscopy Data.

BrillouinView is a Python-based graphical software tool designed for the analysis and visualization of Brillouin zone structures in condensed matter physics. It integrates various scientific libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib to provide interactive plots and tools for analyzing phonon, electronic, and thermodynamic properties. The software utilizes Tkinter for a user-friendly interface, allowing users to load and manipulate data, visualize complex models, and perform calculations.

BrillouinView also uses the BurnMan package for advanced material modeling, so users should ensure that BurnMan is installed before running the software. Key features include data fitting, peak finding, and baseline correction, making it an essential tool for researchers in solid-state physics and materials science.
